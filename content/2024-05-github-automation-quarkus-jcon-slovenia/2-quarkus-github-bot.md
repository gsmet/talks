## "Death by a thousand paper cuts"

-

## Triaging

* Constant flow of issues/pull requests
* Many components with different maintainers
* Need to ping appropriate people

-

## Affecting milestones

* Minor release every month (micro every week)
* ~ 200 issues / pull requests without milestone when releasing
* Heterogeneous team makes it harder

-

## Hard to find cause when CI fails

@Notes:

Develop how important it is for us today,
how we miss it when itâ€™s not there,
how we are deploying it to other projects in the Quarkus ecosystem
