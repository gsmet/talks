@Notes:

Hello JNation.

Today, we will tell you the story of how we scaled the Quarkus project development
and how we automated most of our GitHub workflow with a GitHub App.

We will also show you how you can develop your very own GitHub Apps with Quarkus.
And have fun doing so.

We know you just had lunch and it’s nap time but stay with us, we have cool things to show!

@Notes:

With me is Yoann Rodière, he is the project lead for Hibernate Search and a Quarkus committer.

I’m Guillaume Smet, I mostly work on Quarkus these days and
I’m also the project lead for Hibernate Validator.

As you have figured it out already from my lovely accent,
we are French, coming from France and very happy to be here at JNation today.
