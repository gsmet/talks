## Automation vs paper cuts

* Small paper cuts add up
* Automation streamlines your work
* Quarkus GitHub App can help, quick and easy
* Start small, put in production, and grow from there

@Notes:

* [...]: with a large enough project, even small inconveniences can really slow you down
* [...]: it's a chance to offload plenty of small (or not so small) tasks
* [...]: familiar environment and no boilerplate,
  so you don't spend more time on automation than you would have manually.
* Also means even a small GitHub app is worth it: you can start small [...]
